# str(changes any data type into a string)
# innt()
# float(changes any data type into a decimal)


# problem 1
name = input('What is your name: ')
Age = input('What is your age: ')
#time = input('Good morning. What time is it?')
print ('Hello my name is' + 'Robert' + 17 + ' years old. ')
# String concatenation

# problem 2
Bonus = '200'
# print(300 + int(Bonus)) # result should be 500

# print(300 + int(200)) = 500

#print(300 + Bonus) # result should be 500
# problem 3
print(300 + 200) = 500

# HINT: use w3schools to find a data casting function that will change
# a data type into a boolean

Value = '200'

print(Value.lower() '==' 'true')
# result should be true
