# Create a new document called quiz1.py copy/ paste the following questions
# on your document and answer the following questions.

# quiz rules:
# - There is no talking during the quiz
# - You may only use your classnotes and w3schools.com for reference
# - If you have a question about a quiz question, please raise your hand
# - Once finished, submit your code to your repository using the source control 
# button. Your commit should be "completed quiz 1."

# 1. Name and describe three (3) built-in functions in python. 
# Please write your responses in complete sentences.
"Float() function allows you to turn an integer into a decimal. Input() function allows you to type data into a program and assign it to a variable. " "The len() function returns the length of an object."
# 2. What data type will the following snippet of code output?
print(30/ 232)
"The code will output integers"
# 3.  Identify and name the operator family each of the following
# symbols belongs to.

# and 
# ==
# >
"These symbols belong to the logical operator family."
# 4. Explain the difference between the = operator and the == operator.
# Please write your response in complete sentences.
"The == operator compares if the values are the same." "The = operator assigns a value to a variable."
# 5. Write code that takes a userâ€™s input (as a string), 
# casts it to a float, and prints the result multiplied by 2.
# Input = 50
float(.50)
print(.50 x 2 = 1)
# 6. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
# Please write your response in complete sentences.
"A parameter is a placeholder." "An argument is the actual value of a function."
# 7. What is the difference between a function definition 
# and a function invocation? # Please write your response in 
# complete sentences.
"A function definition describes what the function is." "A function invocation calls the function."
# 8. Why are functions useful in programming? Provide at least two reasons 
# and write your reasons in in complete sentences.
"Functions are useful because they tell computers what to do." "Functions are what give programming the power it has."
# 9. Write a code block that uses the appropriate operator for each scenario
x = 15
y = 20.
# x is greater than y
# x and 15 are both the same
# x and y are not the same`
print(x > y)
print(x == 15)
print(x = y)
# 10. Create a function that will take in two values. Your function should
# take in 1 value as a parameter, and the other value should be passed in by the
# user through the terminal. Your function should compare if the number passed in by
# the user is greater than the number passed in via the parameter and should print out
# the appropriat response of true or false.
def comparevalues():
    user_value = int(input(10)
    print(20 > 10)
